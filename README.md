# poc-css-testing

The intent of this repository is to test and compare different approaches for testing UI, CSS and styles in general.

## What are we comparing?
- Performance (how long does it take to run the tests)
- Resistance to refactor (how hard it is to update the tests after code changes)
- Automation (how automated each strategy is, with less human interaction needed)
- How accurate are the tests (less false positives / false negatives)
